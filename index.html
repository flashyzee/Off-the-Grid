                <p>Spider-Man, the web-slinging hero created by Marvel Comics, is a symbol of courage and responsibility.
                    Originally an ordinary high school student named Peter Parker, he gained incredible powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. 
                    Now, he protects the city of New York, balancing his life as a student with his role as a superhero.
                    From battling iconic villains to saving everyday citizens, Spider-Man proves that anyone can be a hero with the right values.</p>
